 * @brief   Commence an OTA update writing to the specified partition.

 * The specified partition is erased to the specified image size.

 * If image size is not yet known, pass OTA_SIZE_UNKNOWN which will
 * cause the entire partition to be erased.
 *
 * On success, this function allocates memory that remains in use
 * until esp_ota_end() is called with the returned handle.
 *
 * @param partition Pointer to info for partition which will receive the OTA update. Required.
 * @param image_size Size of new OTA app image. Partition will be erased in order to receive this size of image. If 0 or OTA_SIZE_UNKNOWN, the entire partition is erased.
 * @param out_handle On success, returns a handle which should be used for subsequent esp_ota_write() and esp_ota_end() calls.

 * @return
 *    - ESP_OK: OTA operation commenced successfully.
 *    - ESP_ERR_INVALID_ARG: partition or out_handle arguments were NULL, or partition doesn't point to an OTA app partition.
 *    - ESP_ERR_NO_MEM: Cannot allocate memory for OTA operation.
 *    - ESP_ERR_OTA_PARTITION_CONFLICT: Partition holds the currently running firmware, cannot update in place.
 *    - ESP_ERR_NOT_FOUND: Partition argument not found in partition table.
 *    - ESP_ERR_OTA_SELECT_INFO_INVALID: The OTA data partition contains invalid data.
 *    - ESP_ERR_INVALID_SIZE: Partition doesn't fit in configured flash size.
 *    - ESP_ERR_FLASH_OP_TIMEOUT or ESP_ERR_FLASH_OP_FAIL: Flash write failed.
