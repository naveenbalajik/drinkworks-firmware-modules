** Code Signing Certificate

The files in this folder are believed to be the original code signing certificate and private key, generated on 4/7/2020, and uploaded to AWS for signing IoT firmware images.

The certificate had a life of 365 days, and thus expired on 4/8/2021.

These files were added to the repo on 4/29/2021.
The certificate matches the certificate that has been embedded in the ESP firmware (code-signing-cerificate.txt) up to this time.
The private key has not been verfied to the certificate.
